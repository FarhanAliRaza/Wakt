# Wakt - Known Issues & Future Improvements

## üêõ Critical Bugs to Fix

### 1. Internet Speed Degradation
**Severity**: High
**Description**: Internet slows down significantly after blocking a website
**Impact**: Affects overall device internet performance
**Status**: Reported

**Symptoms**:
- Noticeable slowdown in internet browsing after blocking websites
- May affect all network traffic, not just blocked sites
- Performance degradation persists even when accessing non-blocked sites

**Likely Cause**:
- VPN service processing all network traffic inefficiently
- Packet processing loop causing bottlenecks
- DNS resolution delays for all requests

**Potential Solutions**:
- Optimize VPN packet processing to only intercept DNS queries
- Implement more selective traffic filtering
- Add network performance monitoring
- Consider alternative blocking methods (hosts file, DNS server)

### 2. Browser Loop Issue with Open Tabs
**Severity**: High
**Description**: Browser gets stuck in loop when blocked site is open in existing tab
**Impact**: Browser becomes unusable, constant interruption
**Status**: Reported

**Symptoms**:
- Block overlay appears repeatedly
- Browser tries to close tab automatically
- Loop continues indefinitely: tab close ‚Üí block overlay ‚Üí tab close ‚Üí repeat
- User cannot escape the cycle

**Root Cause**:
- Accessibility service detects URL in existing tab
- Browser tab closing logic triggers repeatedly
- No detection of "tab already processed" state

**Potential Solutions**:
- Track processed tabs to avoid re-processing
- Improve tab closing detection logic
- Add timeout/cooldown for tab closing attempts
- Better browser state management

### 3. App Blocking Bypass Issue
**Severity**: High
**Description**: App blocking doesn't work reliably after dismissing block screen
**Impact**: Primary functionality failure, users can bypass blocks
**Status**: Reported

**Symptoms**:
- Block overlay shows once, then app continues to work normally
- App running in background bypasses blocking detection
- Dismissing block screen allows continued app usage
- Block detection doesn't trigger for subsequent app usage

**Root Cause**:
- Accessibility service not detecting app state changes properly
- Background app detection insufficient
- App launch vs. app resume detection issues
- Cooldown period too permissive

**Potential Solutions**:
- Improve background app state monitoring
- Enhance app launch vs. resume detection
- Implement persistent blocking overlay
- Add process monitoring for blocked apps
- Review cooldown logic for apps
