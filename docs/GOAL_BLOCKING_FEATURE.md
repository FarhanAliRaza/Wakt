# Goal-Based Blocking System Documentation

## Overview
The Goal-Based Blocking System is a feature that allows users to create long-term blocking commitments (1-90 days) for apps and websites that cannot be removed until the goal period expires. This feature was added to help users make serious digital detox commitments.

## Implementation Date
- Created: 2025-08-27

## Database Schema

### New Table: `goal_blocks`
```sql
CREATE TABLE goal_blocks (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    type TEXT NOT NULL,  -- 'APP' or 'WEBSITE'
    packageNameOrUrl TEXT NOT NULL,
    goalDurationDays INTEGER NOT NULL,  -- 1 to 90 days
    goalStartTime INTEGER NOT NULL,
    goalEndTime INTEGER NOT NULL,
    challengeType TEXT NOT NULL,  -- 'WAIT', 'CLICK_500', 'QUESTION'
    challengeData TEXT NOT NULL,  -- JSON data for challenge configuration
    isActive INTEGER NOT NULL,
    completedAt INTEGER,  -- Timestamp when goal was completed
    createdAt INTEGER NOT NULL
)
```

- From version 2 to version 3
- Migration path: `WaktDatabase.MIGRATION_2_3`

## Key Features

### Goal Creation
- Users can create goals for 1-90 days
- Goals require:
  - Name (descriptive title)
  - Type (APP or WEBSITE)
  - Package name or URL
  - Duration in days
  - Challenge type (WAIT, CLICK_500, QUESTION)

### Goal Rules
1. **Immutability**: Once created, goals cannot be deleted until expiration
2. **Priority**: Goal blocks take precedence over regular blocks
3. **Auto-completion**: Goals automatically mark as completed when time expires
4. **Persistence**: Goals survive app restarts and device reboots

### UI Indicators
- Goal blocks show special "ðŸŽ¯ LONG-TERM GOAL BLOCK" banner in blocking overlay
- Goals screen shows remaining days
- Completed goals can be removed from the list
- Active goals show lock icon and warning message

## API Usage

### Creating a Goal
```kotlin
val goal = GoalBlock(
    name = "No Social Media for 30 Days",
    type = BlockType.APP,
    packageNameOrUrl = "com.facebook.katana",
    goalDurationDays = 30,
    challengeType = ChallengeType.WAIT,
    challengeData = """{"waitMinutes": 20}"""
)
goalBlockRepository.createGoal(goal)
```

### Checking if App/Website has Active Goal
```kotlin
// In service
val hasGoal = goalBlockDao.getActiveGoalBlock(packageName) != null

// In repository
val isBlocked = goalBlockRepository.isGoalActive(packageNameOrUrl)
```

### Attempting to Delete a Goal
```kotlin
// Will return false if goal is still active
val deleted = goalBlockRepository.tryDeleteGoal(goalId)
```

## Testing Checklist

### Database Tests
- [ ] Goal creation with proper end time calculation
- [ ] Migration from version 2 to 3 works correctly
- [ ] Expired goals are marked as completed
- [Ð½ÐµÐ½Ð°Ð¹ Delete prevention for active goals
- [ ] Proper cleanup of completed goals

### UI Tests
- [ ] Goal creation dialog validation (1-90 days)
- [ ] Navigation from home screen to goals screen
- [ ] Goal list displays correctly with remaining days
- [ ] Cannot delete active goals from UI
- [ ] Completed goals can be removed

### Service Tests
- [ ] App blocking service detects goal blocks
- [ ] Website blocking VPN includes goal blocks
- [ ] Goal blocks show special indicator in overlay
- [ ] Regular blocks and goal blocks work together
- [ ] Goal blocks persist across app restarts

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Goal with 1 day duration
- [ ] Goal with 90 days duration
- [ ] Multiple goals for different apps/websites
- [ ] Goal expiration while app is running
- [ ] Goal expiration while app is closed
- [ ] Switching between regular and goal blocks

## Known Issues & Future Improvements

### Current Limitations
1. No way to extend goal duration once created
2. No statistics or progress tracking for goals
3. No notification when goal is about to expire
4. Cannot pause or temporarily disable goals

### Potential Enhancements
1. Add goal statistics (how many times blocked, etc.)
2. Allow goal extensions before expiration
3. Add motivational messages during goal period
4. Export/import goals for backup
5. Social sharing of completed goals
6. Goal templates for common detox scenarios

## Troubleshooting

### Goal Not Blocking
1. Check if goal is active: `goalBlockDao.getActiveGoalBlock(packageNameOrUrl)`
2. Verify end time hasn't passed
3. Ensure services are running (AppBlockingService, VpnService)
4. Check package name/URL matches exactly

### Cannot Create Goal
1. Check if goal already exists for same package/URL
2. Verify duration is between 1-90 days
3. Check database migration completed successfully

### Goal Not Completing
1. Manual completion: `goalBlockDao.markGoalAsCompleted(goalId)`
2. Check system time is correct
3. Run cleanup: `goalBlockDao.markExpiredGoalsAsCompleted()`

## Code Architecture

```
Goal Blocking System
â”œâ”€â”€ Data Layer
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ GoalBlock (Entity)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ GoalBlockDao (Database Access)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ GoalBlockRepository (Business Logic)
â”œâ”€â”€ UI Layer
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ GoalBlockScreen (Main UI)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ AddGoalDialog (Creation UI)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ GoalBlockViewModel (State Management)
â””â”€â”€ Service Layer
    â”œâ”€â”€ AppBlockingService (App Detection)
    â””â”€â”€ WebsiteBlockingVpnService (DNS Filtering)
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Database Integrity**: Goals use Room database with SQL constraints
2. **Time Manipulation**: System time changes don't affect goal duration
3. **Process Death**: Goals persist through app/service restarts
4. **Uninstall Protection**: Consider backup to cloud (not implemented)

## Performance Impact

- Minimal database overhead (indexed queries)
- No additional battery drain (uses existing services)
- Memory: ~50KB per goal in database
- Network: No impact (local only)

## Version History

### v1.0.0 (2025-08-27)
