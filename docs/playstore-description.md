## Long Description

Take back control of your screen time with Wakt — the privacy-first digital wellness app that actually works.

Unlike other blockers that track your data or show ads, Wakt is completely free, open-source, and keeps all your data on your device. No accounts, no subscriptions, no hidden costs.

📱 BLOCK DISTRACTING APPS
Block any app with customizable challenges. Choose click challenges that make you work to unlock, giving you time to reconsider your impulse.

🌐 BLOCK DISTRACTING WEBSITES
Block time-wasting websites and unwanted content across all browsers. Break free from compulsive browsing habits. Stay focused without disabling your entire browser.

🧱 BRICK YOUR PHONE
The ultimate focus mode. Brick mode locks your entire phone — only essential apps you choose remain accessible. Perfect for deep work, studying, or breaking free from late-night scrolling.

📅 SCHEDULED LOCKS
Set automatic locks for specific times:
• Focus schedules for work hours
• Sleep schedules for bedtime
• Detox schedules for weekends
Your phone enforces your intentions — even when willpower fails.

🔒 COMMITMENT LOCKS
Lock your schedules for 1-90 days to prevent changes. To unlock early, you must type your personal commitment phrase — real friction that keeps you accountable when urges hit.

⚡ QUICK FOCUS SESSIONS
Start instant brick sessions (25 min, 1 hour, 2 hours) with one tap. Your phone becomes a tool, not a temptation.

🛡️ PRIVACY FIRST
• No data collection — ever
• No analytics or tracking
• No advertisements
• No account required
• All data stays on your device
• Fully open-source code

Your blocked sites and apps stay completely private. No one will ever know what you're blocking — not even us.

💪 WHY WAKT WORKS
Most blockers are easy to bypass. Wakt combines brick mode with commitment locks — you physically can't access what you've blocked, and unlocking early requires typing your personal phrase. This friction lets your rational mind override impulses and urges.

🆓 WHY IT'S FREE
I built Wakt for myself. I struggled with phone addiction and couldn't find a blocker that was truly free — no ads, no tracking, no premium features locked behind paywalls. So I built what I needed and decided to share it. If it helps you too, that's the whole point.

🔓 OPEN SOURCE
